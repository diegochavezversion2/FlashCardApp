# FlashCardApp
An app designed to help study by saving flashcards in in decks.
Using the buttons labeled "View", "Study", and "Delete", you can either View a deck, study cards within a deck, or delete a deck.

Within viewing the deck you may edit the deck, study the cards, or delete the cards. 

When studying the Cards, you view one at a time and the front side first, then the back, to simulate a traditional flashcard.
